This project aims to use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to perform multi-label node classification on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) dataset. A model is created which can predict protein functions based on node features (protein characteristics) and edge connections (bonds between proteins). Our model extends the GraphSAGE model defined by Hamilton et. al. to achieve a micro-F1 score of 0.9860 through architectural customizations and hyperparameter tuning.
